ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ZeusMur99,

I currently hold an Economics degree, but I am in the process of earning a Computer Science degree from Oregon State University. Currently, my projects have revolved around web development, writing programs using React and Express, with CSS stylesheets and connectivity to MongoDB databases for data collection and storage.

Below you can find the following projects: 
* __Enactus NCC online store:__ An online marketplace for Guatemalan coffee and chocolate. Enactus NCC is an organization that partners with local coffee farmers and chocolate artisans in direct trade. This eliminates any third-party interference, enabling the locals to set their own prices. The relationship has been mututally beneficial, allowing the locals to access better education and healthcare while simultaneously giving students the opportunity to engage in business practices early on.
